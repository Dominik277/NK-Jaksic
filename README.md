# NK JakÅ¡iÄ‡
NK-Jaksic is a small application about my local football team with all infomartion about results, matches, players and league tables. This app is based on modern Android 
application tech-stacks, and MVVM architecture and also this app is made in single activity multiple fragments design pattern.
App is stil in a process of making.

# About
This app is used mainly for displaying content about my local football club, for now it's implemented that user(later I will implement the design where admin logins and only him 
can insert data in database) in separate fragment inserts data in EditText fields about schedule, results, news, league table, best scorers etc and when he clicks button
that data is stored in database and displayed in RecyclerView.This app is still in process of making so there will be more features in future.

- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
    - [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) - provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.

    - Repository pattern

# Arhitecture
The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:
- A single-activity architecture
- Android architecture components, part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
- Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) facilitating a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- S.O.L.I.D design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
- Modular app architecture allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.
