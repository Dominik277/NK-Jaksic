# NK JakÅ¡iÄ‡
NK-Jaksic is a small application about my local football team with all infomartion about results, matches, players and league tables. This app is based on modern Android 
application tech-stacks, and MVVM architecture and also this app is made in single activity multiple fragments design pattern.
App is stil in a process of making.

# About
This app is used mainly for displaying content about my local football club, for now it's implemented that when user clicks on some specific item in RecyclerView then app navigates him to the detail fragment where there are displayed all informations about some specific match or detail about new news that are bound to the club. When long clicked on some item in RecylcerView we are navigated to a login fragment where admin logs in and only he can update data in database or delete data in database.We add data in a fragments which we open on a menu item click.This app is still in process of making and long from where I imagine it should be so there will be more features in future.

# Arhitecture
The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:
- A single-activity architecture
- Android architecture components, part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
- Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) facilitating a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- S.O.L.I.D design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
- Modular app architecture allows to be developed features in isolation, independently from other features.
